# random-from-text
A C++ program that calculates the frequency of character based on a window size then can return a psuedorandom text file.

# Features
Current functionality, enter a window size and give a text file in proper format and it will return a psuedorandom text file based
on distributions of characters from the given text file.

# Future
To add to the functionality, I intend on creating a tool in python to transfer any text file into one that is readable by my 
program.

I also plan on creating a precompiled version of this program with a config file that will allow the user to just change text fields
and then the program will run as intended without having to compile the C++ code every time.
